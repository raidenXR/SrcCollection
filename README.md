A collection of src code files for general use.   
Inside the `\dotnet` directory are some codes implemented from .NET API, to make working
with zig less frustrating.   

- String
- StringBuilder
- Numerics
- ArrayPool

the `\dotnet` directory is defined as a package in `build.zig` and `build.zig.zon`, so it can   
easily be imported to other zig projects.
